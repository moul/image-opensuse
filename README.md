openSUSE image on Scaleway [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scaleway/image-opensuse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scaleway/image-opensuse)
==========================

Scripts to build the official openSUSE image on Scaleway

This image is built using [Image Tools](https://github.com/scaleway/image-tools) and depends on the [armbuild/opensuse-disk](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/armbuild/opensuse-disk/) Docker image.

**This image is meant to be used on a C1 server.**

We use the Docker's building system and convert it at the end to a disk image that will boot on real servers without Docker. Note that the image is still runnable as a Docker container for debug or for inheritance.
